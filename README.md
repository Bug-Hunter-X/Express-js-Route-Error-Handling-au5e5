This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handling and provides a solution. The `bug.js` file shows incorrect error handling, while `bugSolution.js` demonstrates the proper approach.  The issue involves the lack of a robust way to handle cases where a requested user is not found.  The solution implements more comprehensive error handling using Express's response methods.
